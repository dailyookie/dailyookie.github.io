As many as four residents of Ottawa Canada have recently reported that local cannabis strain *Ridin Thru Kush* has caused [**subconjunctival bleeding**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subconjunctival_bleeding) after as little as one toke.

One Ottawian, Jollie Ollie (seen above) was rushed to hospital before he had even finished his blunt.

The Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation has issued an emergency recall for all *Ridin Thru Kush* products and derivatives.
