Patrons of Melbourne nightclub *Revolver Upstairs* have reportedly spotted Julian Assange in a highly inebriated state.

One regular Revs attendee described the man as *"fucking stoned"* and another said "he looked unhinged, like he hadn't left the place in 7 years!". There have been rumours that Assange escaped Belmarsh some time last month, and there has been no recent verification of his whereabouts by officials or Assange's lawyers.

If you have information about Assange, please contact us.
